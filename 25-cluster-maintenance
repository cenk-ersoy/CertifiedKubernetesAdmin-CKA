# Node eviction timeout is 5 mins
# Check the configuration for "kube-controller-manager"

# Once a node is drained, the node is marked as “un-schedulable”. 
# Then you can upgrade its operating system or apply patches.
kubectl drain node-1  --ignore-daemonsets

# once the node is available, you should uncordon it so that pods can be scheduled
kubectl uncordon node-1

# You can mark a node “un-schedulable” without migrating its pods. 
kubectl cordon node-1


# if a pod is not a part of a ReplicaSet, it will be lost

# drain, cordon and uncordon commands must be run from master node


# get the Kubernetes version for the cluster
kubectl version --short
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep -i IMAGE_ID

# Notice that “kubectl get nodes” does NOT report the version of “kube-apiserver”. 
# It shows the version of “kubelet” on each node. You must still manually upgrade the “kubelet” on each node.
kubectl get nodes -o wide


# the "kubeadm" utility shows which version you can upgrade
kubeadm version
kubeadm upgrade plan

# you must always upgrade "kubeadm" utility itself first.
apt update
apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.20.0-00


# here is how you can upgrade the master node

kubectl drain controlplane --ignore-daemonsets

apt update
apt-get install kubeadm=1.20.0-00

kubeadm upgrade plan v1.20.0
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.0

apt-get install kubelet=1.20.0-00
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet

kubectl uncordon controlplane 



# next you must upgrade worker nodes 
# you must drain the worker node from master node
kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

# ssh to node and do the following

apt update
apt-get install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
# notice "node" here
kubeadm upgrade node

apt-get install kubelet=1.20.0-00
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet

# do the following on the master node to finish the worker node upgrade
# Note that once the worker node is up again, the pods do NOT migrate back to the node
kubectl uncordon node01
kubectl get pods -o wide 



# None of the components can have release number higher than the “kube-apiserver”.
# Recommended upgrade approach is to upgrade one minor version at a time.
